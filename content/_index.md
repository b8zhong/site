Hi! I'm a student from Ottawa, ON. I currently study electrical and computer engineering @ the University of Waterloo.

I'm interested in software systems and NLP. Right now, Iâ€™m a big fan of [TypeScript], [C++], and [Python].

At the University of Waterloo, I'm involved in [Electrium Mobility] - as well as being a community rep at [CSClub].

In my free time, I try to do cool or new stuff! Check out my [Github].
